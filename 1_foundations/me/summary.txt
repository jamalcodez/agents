My name is Jamal Freeman. I'm an associtate at Bimbo Bakeries, but I am an expiring entrepreneur.
I love all foods, particularly Fast food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
